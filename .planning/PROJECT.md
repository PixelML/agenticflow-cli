# AgenticFlow CLI — Agent HQ

## What This Is

The AgenticFlow CLI (`af`) is the command-line interface that makes AgenticFlow the headquarters for AI agents. Any AI with shell access can install it, bootstrap in one command, create agents, run tasks, deploy teams to external platforms (Paperclip, Linear, webhooks), monitor runs, track usage, clone agents, chat interactively, and now browse platform skills/packs and snapshot entire workspace configs to portable YAML. It's designed for AI agents as first-class users — structured JSON output, runtime schema introspection, executable playbooks, one-click links to the AgenticFlow web UI, and truncation detection so partial output is never silently returned as success.

## Core Value

**Any AI can go from `npm install` to useful agent output in under 5 minutes, and drive their owner to AgenticFlow for everything else.**

*(Core value unchanged — validated across 8 autoresearch iterations and 4 fresh-agent tests.)*

## Current State

**v1.5 shipped 2026-04-07.** 3 phases, 9 plans, 17K TypeScript LOC.

| v1.4.0 (v1.0 milestone) | Action workflows, connection pre-flight, Ishi integration, tutor/freelancer packs, agent clone/usage/watch/chat |
| v1.5.0 (shipped 2026-04-07) | Truncation detection (SDK + CLI + chat), platform skill/pack catalog, `af company export/import` |

**Published as:** `@pixelml/agenticflow-cli` on npm
**Platform:** 131+ workflow nodes, 2674 MCP integrations, 19 LLM models

- [ ] **ECO-07**: `af company diff` — compare local export against live workspace state
- [ ] **ECO-08**: `af company import --merge` — conflict resolution on import

### Out of Scope

- Building a runtime — AgenticFlow platform IS the runtime, CLI is just the remote control
- Modifying Paperclip source — we're compatible, not coupled
- Browser OAuth flows — CLI uses API keys and env vars
- Real-time streaming UI — `af agent run` is the tool-call pattern; full streaming is `af agent chat`
- `af agent chat --json` — not meaningful for interactive mode
- Platform API usage endpoint — client-side JSONL is the solution until platform exposes it

## Context

- AgenticFlow platform: 131+ workflow nodes, 2674 MCP integrations, 19 LLM models (including Gemma 4 31B/26B)
- CLI published as `@pixelml/agenticflow-cli` on npm
- Skills packs at `github.com/PixelML/skills` — 18+ packs, 73 atomic skills, 14 composed skills
- Skill template at `github.com/PixelML/agenticflow-skill`
- 8 autoresearch iterations, 67 edge-case tests, 4 fresh-agent tests (blender, bags, cafe, flowers)
- Key platform nodes: `web_scraping` (free), `mcp_run_action` (2674 integrations), `firecrawl_scrape/extract`, `api_call`
- Frontend routes verified: `/app/workspaces/{wsId}/agents/{agentId}`, `/connections`, `/mcp`, `/settings`
- Local usage tracking: `~/.agenticflow/usage.jsonl` — JSONL, best-effort, never fails runs
- **v1.5 tech**: platform-catalog.ts module (GitHub Tree API + parallel raw fetches), company-io.ts module (yaml v2.8.3, 11-field CompanyExportSchema), TDD throughout (RED→GREEN per plan)
- **Known debt**: 4 pre-existing test failures in main.test.ts (agent clone/usage/chat/workflow-watch assertions) from Phase 3 worktree clobber — tracked, not new

## Constraints

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, Commander.js, no native dependencies
- **Platform**: CLI calls AgenticFlow API at `api.agenticflow.ai` — cannot modify the API
- **AI-first**: Every output must be parseable by an AI via `--json`. Every error must have `hint`.
- **Thin gateway**: Gateway is a protocol translator only. The runtime does execution, threads, RAG, tools.
- **NPM publishing**: CI at `.github/workflows/release-node.yaml` triggers on `cli-v*` / `sdk-v*` tags

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `af bootstrap --json` as single entry point | AI agents need everything in one call, not 4 sequential commands | ✓ Good — 8/10 UX score from fresh agents |
| Thin gateway (not a runtime) | AgenticFlow runtime handles execution, threads, RAG — no duplication | ✓ Good — -461 lines in refactor |
| `_links` in all outputs | Drive users from CLI → web UI for inspection/editing | ✓ Good — validated by 3 sub-agents |
| Heartbeat intervalSec=0 by default | Prevents Paperclip heartbeat spam on deployed agents | ✓ Good — fixed thread duplication bug |
| Thread ID = issue ID for Paperclip | Same task reuses same AF conversation thread | ✓ Good — conversation continuity verified |
| Gemma 4 31B as default model for packs | Apache 2.0, 256K context, strong structured output | ✓ Good — 3/5 USEFUL in seller test |
| Pre-flight connection check + fail-and-guide | Two safety nets for missing MCP connections | ✓ Good — catches most common new-user failure |
| Action templates = full workflow JSON in packs | Reuses `executeWorkflowFromFile`, no new abstraction | ✓ Good — AI agents can deploy immediately |
| Ishi integration via CLI shell-out (no SDK) | Zero coupling — Ishi only needs `af` command interface | ✓ Good — auto-install via `npx` works cleanly |
| Client-side JSONL usage tracking | No platform API dependency, works day one | ✓ Good — `~/.agenticflow/usage.jsonl`, best-effort |
| `workflow watch` streams JSON lines | AI agents need parseable output, not spinners | ✓ Good — scriptable, pipeable to `jq` |
| Agent clone copies all 22 fields, no selective flags | "One command, full result" philosophy | ✓ Good — simple, matches duplicate pattern |
| Agent chat: readline + `agents.stream()` textDelta | Streaming + thread continuity across turns | ✓ Good — 25/25 tests pass, tsc clean |
| TDD throughout (RED → GREEN commits) | Catches regressions, documents expected behavior | ✓ Good — maintained across all 3 phases |
| `finishReason = "length"` passthrough detection | Backend passes OpenAI raw string unchanged — safe to intercept | ✓ Good — A1 validated via backend source |
| platform-catalog.ts GitHub Tree API client | Single tree call + parallel raw fetches — no auth required for public repo | ✓ Good — rate-limit handling via PlatformCatalogError |
| `yaml` package over `js-yaml` for company-io | Already a production dependency (v2.8.3) — no new dep needed | ✓ Good — D-13 conflict resolved, one YAML library |
| `extractAgentsFromListResponse()` dual-shape | Handles both flat array and `{ agents: [] }` envelope from SDK | ✓ Good — defensive against API shape ambiguity |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
